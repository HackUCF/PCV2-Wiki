# Overview of OpenStack GUI

## Projects

A project is a pool of shared virtual resources, to which you can assign OpenStack users and groups. Each project is sectioned off with its own resources. There is a drop-down menu in the top left corner of Horizon, displaying all the projects running on our infrastructure. Clicking through will change which project you are interacting with.

## API Access

Displays the services and their endpoints that the GUI connects to.

## Compute

This is where most operations will occur.

- **Overview**: Displays resource usage and availability within the project.
- **Instances**: Displays all currently running instances in the project and allows you to create, delete, or edit instances.
- **Images**: Displays all images allowed for your project. You can add, launch, or delete images with permissions.
- **Keypairs**: Allows you to upload your own key pair or have OpenStack create one for you, for remote access to instances.
- **Server Groups**: Specifies a set of servers that must run on the same system or on different systems.
- **Volume**: Provides detachable block storage devices for instances, enabling persistent storage.
  - **Backups**: Stores backups of data from instances.
  - **Snapshots**: Captures the state of an instance at a specific point in time.
- **Groups**: A collection of users within a domain, dividing members into groups that can change permissions and access levels.
- **Group Snapshots**: A snapshot of a group of volumes created simultaneously.

## Networks

- **Network Topology**: Displays information on the architecture of the cloud project, showing instances, routers, servers, etc., in a graph or topology image.
- **Networks**: Allows creation or modification of networks, setting IP ranges and external/internal access.
- **Routers**: Builds a router that can connect to the external network (e.g., the internet).
- **Security Groups**: Defines rules controlling communication between instances and the internet.
- **Float IP**: Configures and launches floating IPs for instances to be publicly accessible.
- **Trunk**: Groups logical ports from different networks to provide a single-trunked vNIC for servers.

## Orchestration

- **Stacks**: A collection of resources managed by the platform.
- **Resource Types**: Lists all resources used, allowing users to specify multiple rules when creating a composite alarm.
- **Template Versions**: Corresponds to different versions of Heat, the primary orchestration component automating resources, infrastructure, applications, and services.
- **Template Generator**: Sets variables within a template using input data, enabling reuse of the same template to generate content.

## Object Store

Used for redundant, scalable data storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of accessible data.

## Identity Tab

- **Projects**: Lists available projects.
- **Users**: Lists all users in the project.
- **Application Credentials**: Temporary credentials allowing applications to authenticate to OpenStack.
